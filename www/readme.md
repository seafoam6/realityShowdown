A phone app using Ionic, Angular, and Firebase to watch and enjoy Rupaul's drag race with friends. Points are acquired by predicting the winning queens.

The stuff is kind of a mess. I was in the middle of working on the scoring feature.

It does work in that people can create a login, and vote for a week that's open.

Things that would be great for anyone to work on if they have time:

* Twitter or facebook login. There's walkthrus on the firebase site on how to set these up, I haven't had time yet.
* Refactoring. There's a lot of mess because I wasn't used to working with firebase. A lot of stuff can be put in factories/services to seperate concerns.
* TDD: good luck with that.
* Scoring.
* General look and feel. Theres' a lot of native Ionic functionality that could be added pretty easily and would make a big difference.

Hopefully you can help with the project!!!
